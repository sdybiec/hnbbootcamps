# Online Workshops - Best Practices

San Francisco City Team

---

## Before the event
- Have participants as ready as possible before the event
  - prerequisites 
    - cloud sign up with the vcpi link
    - creating services
    - [sample video on Watson Studio prerequisites](https://www.loom.com/share/39ea49dbbae244a3917782737af28504)
  - additional links (to create excitement)
    - relevant code patterns
    - related readings on developer.ibm.com 

---

## Invite matters!
  - Does your event description have catchy title
  - easy to understand description of the workshop including value add / benefits
  - who the audience is / who should attend
- Email a day or two before the event reminding everyone to complete the prerequisites in order to have an enjoyable time at the workshop! Don't worry, you will still get folks who didn't read the email or didn't have time. 

---

## Day of the event
  - Sign in early on the day of the event to welcome folks. Have a couple of ice breaker questions/topics:
    - where you joining from?
    - wfh tips to share?
    - ask people how they are doing.
  - Show a poll to get more interaction
    - Have you created a chatbot before (yes, no)
    - Development experience (front end, back end, designer, architect, data scientist, other)


---

## During the workshop
  - Have a host to help out - highly recommended!
  - Multiple monitors are helpful if you are the speaker and the host. Workshop on one monitor and manage the event on the second monitor.
  - Have a clear "click to action" link. This can link to a public page that has other resources
    - vcpi link (shorten the link for readability)
    - github repo
    - other resources
  - it's okay to make mistakes, leverage your mistake as a teaching moment.
  - Use polls/comments heavily to ask for feedback.
  - It's okay to repeat for some people, but it's hard to hand hold individually.

## Tips for technical/coding workshops
  - give them a starting point. This can be a github repo
  - provide code snippets that they can copy paste. This is not a test of how fast people can type :)
  - use github branches to provide each step.

## How to pick a platform to host the workshop?
  - preferably no installation required and runs in the browser
  - customizable registration form? Be careful on how much information you ask for
  - comments/chat area to mingle?
  - dedicated question area / or a way to curate from the chat area?
  - polling feature? You can also use <https://www.sli.do/>
  - is the event recorded? The workshop will be fast for some people to follow along. Give them an option to complete later
  - does it stream to other platforms?
  - No, you don't have to use crowdcast to host a successful workshop!

---

## After the event
  - Thank folks for attending and send all resources (slides, github repo, etc) to the people who registered (not just attended) for the event. You can tell them about the next event in this communication. Do this sooner than later. 
  - curate all questions from the chat and write a blog post
  - share the video you crated on other channels
  - If you have external speakers presenting, best to do a dry run or a session to make them familiar with the tooling/experience. We have a document that we share with external speakers on what to expect and how to prepare.
